## This is a repository for solutions of the leetcode problems attempted by me.

Solutions will be primarily in python and java

Each question will have a dedicated folder with code named as `main.py` or `main.java` reprectively

The question will be attempted in a fairly linear fashion relative to the leetcode numbering
